# Burger-logger
This burger-logger app is an app where users can add a burger of their choice and and it is then added to the list, then when you click on the button "Order-up", it appears as devoured and moves to the right as devoured.

I used html, css, javascript, Node.js, mysql, express-handlebars, orm, model views, controllers ..for this app.
